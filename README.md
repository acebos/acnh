## Timing
Time is determined by your Nintendo Switch’s local time. Though midnight local time changes the date, a new “day” in ACNH officially starts at 🕔 **`5:00 am`**, when daily announcements are made on your island, dailies “refill”, visitors arrive/leave, and projects make progress.

#### ☀️ Daytime, 5:00 am — 5:59 pm
| ⏰ Time | 🗓️ Event |
| :--- | :--- | 
| 🕔 **`5:00 am`** | Day begins |
| 🕘 **`8:00 am`** | Nook’s Cranny opens |
| 🕙 **`9:00 am`** | Able Sisters opens |

#### 🌙 Nighttime, 6:00 pm — 4:59 am
| ⏰ Time | 🗓️ Event |
| :--- | :--- | 
| 🕘 **`9:00 pm`** | Able Sisters closes |
| 🕙 **`10:00 pm`** | Nook’s Cranny closes |

#### Every day/night switch
* Certain critters appear/disappear
* Certain villages are more/less active
* Balloon presents switch sides by spawning from the opposite beach

## Tool durability <sub><sup><sub>[`source`](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/31/21194209/durability-list-broken-breaking-shovel-axe-fishing-rod-watering-can-slingshot-bug-net)</sub></sup></sub>

Tools only wear down when your action is successful. Ladders, Vaulting Poles, and Wands will not break. Watering empty land decreases a Watering Can’s durability by 10% of its use on flower(s).
